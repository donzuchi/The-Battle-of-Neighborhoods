DESCRIPTION OF THE IDEA

The Battle of Neighborhoods

The main idea for this capstone project named “The Battle of Neighborhoods” is to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities,
New York City and Toronto, and determine how similar or dissimilar they are.

We are going to leverage the Foursquare location data to explore the neighborhoods of these two amazing cities.

In New York City, we will explore the neighborhoods of Brooklyn; in Toronto, we will explore the neighborhoods of Scarborough.
We will compare these boroughs to find which one has more venues than the other one. Hence, this will be our audience.
We will analyze the venues categories to figure out if there is an opportunity to start a new business in a certain neighborhood.

A new business could be a coffee shop, bar, bakery, gym, or restaurant. For example, if we find that in the first neighborhood
of Scarborough in Toronto there is only a restaurant of hamburgers; we can open an Italian Food Restaurant since this kind
of food is missing in this place. The people or citizens in this neighborhood will accept this restaurant because they will enjoy
different choises of food.
