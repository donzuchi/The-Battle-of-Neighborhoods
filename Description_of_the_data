DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA

New York City - Brooklyn

In order to segment the neighborhoods and explore them, we will essentially need a dataset that contains the 5 boroughs and
the neighborhoods that exist in each borough as well as the latitude and longitude coordinates of each neighborhood.
This dataset exists for free on the web. On the other hand, for our convenience, the file was placed it on the server, so we can
simply run a ‘wget’ command and access the data.

After downloading this dataset, we will transform it into a pandas dataframe and use the geopy library to get the latitude and longitude
values of New York City to create a map with its neighborhoods. Then, we will cluster and segment the neighborhoods in Brooklyn to find
the first neighborhood for the analysis.

Being Bay Ridge the first neighborhood in Brooklyn, we will create the GET request URL to find the nearest venues. Also, we will
determine which neighborhood in Brooklyn has more venues and we will group them as per category. Then, we will find the top 5 venues
in Brooklyn in order to find insights.

Toronto - Scarborough

Unlike New York City, the neighborhood data is not readily available on the internet. For the Toronto neighborhood data, a Wikipedia
page exists that has all the information we need to explore and cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto.

We will scrape the Wikipedia page and wrangle the data, clean it, and then read it into a pandas dataframe. Once the data
is in a structured format, we can replicate the analysis that we did to the New York City dataset to explore and cluster
the neighborhoods in the city of Toronto.

After the mention procedure, we will use the geopy library to get the latitude and longitude values of Toronto to create a map
with its neighborhoods. Then, we will cluster and segment the neighborhoods in Scarborough to find the first postal code for the
analysis.

Being Malvern and Rouge the neighborhoods of the first postal code M1B in Scarborough, we will create the GET request URL to find
the nearest venues of this postal code. On the other hand, we will determine which neighborhood in Scarborough has more venues
and we will group them as per category. Then, we will find the top 5 venues in Scarborough in order to find insights.

Brooklyn vs Scarborough

Finally, by means of the insights founds in Brooklyn and Scarborough, we will determine if we can open a new business in terms
of the people needs.
